### ðŸ“– About

Brainlytic offers interesting mathematical and logical problems for youngsters of all ages (starting from elementary up to high school). Most of our problems encourage interactivity. The others have carefully designed explanatory graphics. The young minds can tinker with the provided tools as they try to solve our diverse assortment of problems and puzzles. This helps in visualization and ease of exploring new possibilities during problem solving. Unlike most of the applications that offer variations of orthodox textbook problems, Brainlytic offers creative problems based on real world examples; thus encouraging in-depth and out-of-the box thinking. Our thought-provoking and interactive perspective at problem solving will help youngsters realize the beauty and fun of mathematics; while our carefully designed logical puzzles will promote algorithmic thinking and help them tackle real-world puzzles too.  


The app will display a detailed report of a userâ€™s progress and performance. One can reattempt any previously failed problem as those are shown separately. Many problems also have hints to guide users if they get stuck. All the problems come with a detailed explanation, to ensure proper understanding of the idea behind the problem. Another philosophy of this application is not to confine the users to a specific grade. S/he will be exposed to problems of different levels and in the near future, the system will recommend problems based on his/her progress.
The existing unorthodox problem solving platforms such as Math Olympiad, Math Kangaroo, etc. are often too challenging for the majority of the students of corresponding level. This eventually attracts only a certain group of students to participate. However, our target is a much wider audience. Our problems range from elementary level, basic math problems to tougher puzzles for high-schoolers. Also, at each level, basic, intermediate and a bit tough problems are designed on the same concept. A large majority of the students will find problems to try and enjoy in Brainlytic.
